    <h1>Chapter One</h1>
    <p>This page will include content about:
        <ul>
            <li>What Lorem Ipsum is</li>
            <li>Why we use it</li>
            <li>Where it came from</li>
            <li>And where a person can get some</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before the final copy is available</p>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p>Why do we use Lorem Ipsum?
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
